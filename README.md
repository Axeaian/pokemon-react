# Pokedex React Store

Understand how the structure of the React component looks like
and start doing the exercises

All the pokemon assets and information are provided in `data.txt`
The css for this exercise is given in `index.css` or feel free to customise the page to your liking

### Exercise 1
* Create a single pokemon card in JSX
* Take a single pokemon data provided in `data.txt` to display in `Card` component
* Data should be placed in App.js and be passed down. Think top-down approach. Data is passed down to another component
* Capitalise property `type` in each individual `Card` component
